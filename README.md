JAVASCRIPT QUIZ ABOUT NBA BASKETBALL.

This is a test quiz about users knowledge and familiarity about NBA basketball.
I used HTML, JAVASCRIPT AND CSS to come up with this owesome application.

EARLY STEPS
HTML
I used HTML to create the outline of the interface, creating all the buttons, diplay area and the layout of the page.

CSS
I used CSS to add some styles and colours to make the page attractive to users.

JAVASCRIPT
I used JAVASCRIPT to make the app responsive, activate all the buttons and enable the app function the right way.


Heres a link to view how the APP works: https://bremah-mvp.github.io/Javascript-Quiz/

                        HOW IT WORKS
The quiz starts at 30 seconds.

The time never stops when u hit start button.

It has a maximum of five questions about NBA basketball. 

Each question comes with 5 choices of answers u can select.

You must select an answer to be presented with the next question.

ONLY THE RIGHT ANSWER ACTIVATES THE NEXT QUESTION.

When you select the WRONG ANSWER  u dont get to the next question, you loose a few
seconds and also continue to loose more time until you select the right answer.

Time lost increases as u take more time looking for th right answer.


When the time erapses, or when the timer counts down to 0, the user will be presented with 
the final scores.

USER can then enter desired initials to save the highscores..
The quiz then resetts for the user to play again..


    !GOOD LUCK with this extremely fun game..!
